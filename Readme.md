# Role of Artificial Intelligence in Decision-Making

## Overview
This project explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on contemporary management practices. It investigates how AI integrates into strategic, operational, human resource, and marketing decision-making processes. The study combines theoretical frameworks with quantitative analysis to measure the relationship between AI adoption and managerial efficiency in leading technology firms (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple).

## Objectives
- Examine AI integration in strategic and operational decision-making.
- Assess the impact of AI on employee productivity and decision accuracy.
- Identify best practices from top global corporations.
- Evaluate the relationship between employee training and AI effectiveness.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated dataset generated based on industry trends (McKinsey, IBM, Statista reports).
- **Size:** 250 observations.
- **Key Variables:** AI Adoption Score, Productivity Index, Decision Speed Index, Decision Accuracy, Employee Satisfaction, and Training Hours.

## Methodology & Approach
- **Literature Review:** Analyzed best practices from major tech giants (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM).
- **Data Simulation:** Generated realistic corporate data using Python (NumPy/Pandas) to replicate industry patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations (Boxplots, Heatmaps).
  - Correlation Analysis (Pearson).
  - OLS Regression Modeling to predict productivity.
  - ANOVA to compare AI adoption across different companies.

## Key Findings & Results
- **Productivity:** A strong positive correlation ($r \approx 0.56$) exists between AI adoption and employee productivity.
- **Regression Analysis:** The model explains approximately 40% of the variance in productivity ($R^2 \approx 0.401$), confirming AI is a significant predictor.
- **Decision Quality:** Higher AI adoption is associated with increased decision accuracy ($r \approx 0.53$) and faster decision speeds.
- **Training Impact:** Employee training hours significantly correlate ($r \approx 0.43$) with successful AI implementation.
- **Company Variance:** Statistically significant differences in AI adoption were found, with Google showing the highest mean adoption in the simulated set.

## Visualizations
- Mean AI Adoption Score by Company (Bar Chart).
- AI Adoption vs. Productivity (Scatter Plot with Trendline).
- Correlation Matrix Heatmap.
- Distribution Boxplots of AI Adoption.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Other:** MS Excel, MS Word.
